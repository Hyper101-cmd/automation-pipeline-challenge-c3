## üìã Overview

The **automation-pipeline-challenge-c3** project focuses on automating infrastructure management and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) processes. This tool allows you to effortlessly deploy, manage, and maintain your infrastructure using simple scripts and configurations. With **Ansible playbooks** and a **GitOps workflow**, you can streamline your deployment procedures and enhance security. Our goal is to help you save time and reduce complexity in managing your infrastructure.

## üíª System Requirements

To run this application, you need:

- A computer with Linux (Ubuntu is recommended)
- At least 4GB of RAM
- 1GHz processor or higher
- Internet connection for downloading dependencies

## üöÄ Features

- **Ansible Playbooks**: Easily manage server configurations and application deployments.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate your deployment process from code to production.
- **GitOps Workflow**: Use Git as a single source of truth for your infrastructure.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Integrated tools for observability and issue tracking.
- **Security Management**: Regular updates and patch management to keep your environment secure.
- **SSL Configuration**: Simplify the management of SSL Certificates for your applications.

## üîç How It Works

This application uses a combination of scripts and playbooks to manage your infrastructure. You will set up your servers via Ansible playbooks, ensuring that your configurations are consistent across different environments. The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of testing and deploying your applications, allowing you to focus on development rather than deployment.
